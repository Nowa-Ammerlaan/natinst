# @BLURB: An eclass that helps automating the creation of ebuilds for software only distributed through rpm
# @DESCRIPTION:
# This extends the rpm eclass to also installs *all* files in the rpm, and
# extracts post/pre(un)install scripts and runs them.
#
# This is mostly useful when creating ebuilds for rpm files in bulk. In cases
# where it is not doable to write a Gentoo specific src_install and
# pkg_post/pre/install/rm functions for each ebuild.

# The rpm eclass provides the pkg_unpack function we need
